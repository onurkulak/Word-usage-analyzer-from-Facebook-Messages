# Word-usage-analyzer-from-Facebook-Messages
A data analyzing project using Facebook Messages. 
Most frequently used word by each of your friends, patterns in their word usages. 
Your talking frequency with each of your friends over time etc. 

All the information that can be derived from your personal messages is going to be visualized & turned into graphs.
Currently in development, so only word frequency for each of your friends can be shown.

How to use:
First you need to export your own data (or steal someone else's)from Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/help/131112897028467
Then you need to extract this data.
After extracting the data you can run the jar file in the dist directory.
From the first window of the program select the "messages.htm" file under "html" directory
Wait a little bit until you can see your contacts in the left panel of the program, otherwise program crashes (this will be fixed)
Then choose among your friends to see which words they use the most common. 
Unfortunately these will mostly be stop words, since program can't detect them in every language (yet) However English might me added soon
